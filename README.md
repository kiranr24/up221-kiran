# up221-kiran

## Hello! A little about me  

I'm Kiran (she/her), a 2nd year MPH in the Environmental Health Sciences Department at Fielding. I work primarily in understanding the impact climate change will have on human health, working to utilize data to conceputalize impacts and community & creativity to conceptualize solutions. I'm from the SF Bay Area, and value my connections to California to understand the complexities of our ecosystem alongside mangaging the needs of our population, specifically the more marginalized identities. I am currently also a TA for the PH 200 class at Fielding as well as a data analyst for the non-profit Root and Rebound, based out of Oakland. When not working or at school, I use my free time to explore LA -- hiking in the Santa Monica mountains, swimming at any of the beaches around LA, sharing a meal with friends, or exploring the art scene in our city.

This space will be used in conjunction with my work in the class UP 221 at UCLA, a course centered around using GIS tools and spatial data science to quantify and understand communities. I aim to use the information I learn in this class to create visualiations and interpretation of valuable data, and be interpid in my exploration of a field I don't have an existing background. I am still unsure about what I'd like to dissect for this class, but I'd be interested in looking at the links between green space and physical health of communities.
